					<p><strong>Aaliya Singh</strong> and <strong>Yohaan Master</strong> are a couple living in Singapore. Both are NPS students, and were friends for years before they started dating at the beginning of their IB Diploma Program in 2023. They have been in a stable, loving relationship ever since. Being a power couple, they are central to most events that take place within their school, and are icons in their respective fields.</p>
					<p>Aaliya is an accomplished artist, and also has expertise in a wide variety of fields, encompassing history and English literature. She is also renowned for her impeccable eye for aesthetic and fashion. However, despite her focus on the liberal arts, she is a notable biology student, and her skills in the subject have bled over into her art, creating a stunning creative blend. Her teachers have identified her as their favourite on numerous occasions, both subliminally and outright. Some sources<sup>1</sup> have also named her as the "cutest person alive" and "the love of my life" on occasion.</p>
					<p>Yohaan is a primarily STEM-focused student, who also has a keen interest in the liberal arts and social studies. While his focus (and career) lies with software and computers, his passions also include other engineering disciplines, music, and film. He is also a member of the NPS student senate.</p>
					<p>Both tend to have interests that either complement or coincide with each other, allowing both to grow and learn from each other while still being able to enjoy what they have in common.</p>

					<h2 id="history">History</h2>
					<h3 id="pre-ib">Pre-IB</h3>
					<p>The pair first met in the fifth grade, where they shared a homeroom class. They were friends, and spent time in a trio along with a classmate, Sanjita Paspulati (who continues to be close friends with Aaliya). Even at this point, their shared sense of humour and general derangedness brought them together<sup>2</sup>.</p>
					<p>The next time they shared a homeroom was in the eighth grade. Despite the challenges that COVID brought (including home-based learning)<sup>3</sup>, they were still able to spend significant amounts of time together over the course of the year. While still being friends, they both also separately developed feelings for each other. However, due to circumstance<sup>4</sup>, these were never expressed.</p>
					<p>During IGCSE, they were not in the same homeroom. However, Yohaan still occasionally went over to Aaliya's homeroom class in lunch to hang out and talk. At the end of 10th grade especially, leading up to the board season, they spent much more time together during school breaks. Around this time, they also started to sporadically talk on Instagram, especially on New Years Eve in 2022 (leading into 2023), where they discovered a shared love of city pop.</p>
					<h3 id="ib">IB</h3>
					<p>At the start of 11th grade, they found out that they shared a homeroom class again, and continued to speak on Instagram (as well as on Whatsapp) with increasing frequency. Privately, Yohaan also resolved to ask Aaliya out on a date within the first few months of the academic year.</p>
					<p>This culminated in the week leading up to the school Carnival, when he asked her out for coffee after the event was over. She agreed, and they immediately started to talk on Whatsapp on a much more regular basis.</p>

					<p>Their first date took place in 2023, on the 26th of August. They went to Haji Lane, where they had a wonderful time having mochi and drinks, as well as walking along the lit-up shops. After another date<sup>5</sup> and spending more time together in school, they eventually became official on the first of October that year.</p>
					<p>Also in October, they went together on a school-organised trip to Laos, where they spent large amounts of time enjoying each other's company and bonding. They were also notable van-buddies. Their friends capitalised on this trip to take a large number of "candid" pictures of them, which they were generally very aware of.</p>
					<p>At the very end of the year, they went to Our Tampines Hub together to celebrate New Years. After watching the fireworks, they welcomed 2024 (and co-incidentally, their 3 month anniversary) with their first kiss. As 2024 progresses, they have continued to celebrate more milestones together and fall more in love with each other.</p>
					<h2 id="collaborations">Collaborations</h2>
					<p>While the two frequently work together on projects<sup>6</sup>, there are two major things which they continue to update and explore: a shared Spotify playlist and collaborative Pinterest board. Both were created by Aaliya, which Yohaan appreciates on a daily basis and is eternally grateful for.</p>
					<h3 id="spotify">Spotify Playlist</h3>
					<p>The Spotify playlist, named "you look like you enjoyed that one sonny :0", was made on the 6th of September in 2023. The name is a reference to their fifth grade English teacher<sup>7</sup>, who mispronounced "sonny" while quoting this line from Charlie and the Chocolate Family. The playlist itself is a way for the two to share music with each other and create an archive of the songs which they love. Notable artists in the playlist include beabadoobee, Lamp, Mac deMarco, Mitski, and TV girl. Yohaan listens to it everyday, and looks forward to every new addition to it.</p>
					<h3 id="pinterest">Pinterest Board</h3>
					<p>The Pinterest board, named "My love is mine all mine", was sent on the 30th of October in 2023. The name is a reference to the Mitski song of the same name. According to Aaliya, she made the board privately, and waited until it reached 50 pins before sending it to Yohaan. The board has a wide bouquet of images, but some common subjects include red pandas, strawberries, nature, and couples. They use the "Note to group" feature to send each other private comments and notes, mostly in relation to the pin which the note is on. These range from flirty one-liners<sup>8</sup> to poems of varying length. According to Yohaan, his favourite poem from Aaliya is as follows.</p>
					<p><em>I want to watch an eternity of sunsets with you,<br>and even that many donâ€™t seem like enough.<br>Because no amount of light, no hue<br>can really quite capture my love.</em></p>
					<h2 id="future">Future</h2>
					<p>No-one knows what the future holds. But what I do know is that my future will be perfect as long as I can hold you. I hope that our mental Wikipedia page continues to grow and blossom over the years, till it's too big to fit on any website. And maybe one day we'll have a place of our own with strawberry plants galore and a really really good speaker system. Happy 6 month anniversary cutie <3 and here's to many more anniversaries in the future. I love you.</p>
